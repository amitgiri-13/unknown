# Reversing the signed and unsigned integer
This program reverses the integer in the range of [-2^31,2^31 -1]

## Negative integer
For negative integers, the sign should be at its fore position, only the digits should be reversed.

## Positive integer
For positive integers, just the digits are reversed.

## Integers ending with 0
For those integers which ends with 0, while reversing, the 0 should be omitted. For example, 120 should be reversed as 21.

## Test Program
 The test_reverse program tests some of the testcases.
